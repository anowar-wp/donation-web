                <p>How do I build a house in flood prone area?
                    In flood prone areas, houses should be built on a raised column or plinth beam foundation. The space below the house should be left open to facilitate the natural flow of water. Low weight houses can be built on concrete pillars on moderate budget. Besides, houses built this way could withstand earthquakes and floods.</p>
